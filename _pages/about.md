# üí¨ About Me


Hi! My name is Hangqi Li (ÊùéËà™Â•á), a senior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science & Technology at [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I currently hold a GPA of 3.93/4.0, ranking top 2% among 301 students, and expect to receive my degree in June, 2025.

I am broadly interested in Applied Machine Learning, Controllable Generative Models and AI for Common Good. I have been doing research engaged in AI4Science to apply CV and NLP techniques to address real-world problems, as an intern advised by [Prof. Fei Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XJLn4MYAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) Digital Media Computing and Design (DCD) Lab. I'm now a research intern with [Prof. Zeyu Zheng](https://zheng.ieor.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR), focusing on controllable generation of structured data such as music and images.

**UniComposer: Band-Level Music Composition with Symbolic and Audio Unification**

**Hangqi Li**, [Zeyu Zheng](https://zheng.ieor.berkeley.edu/)

***Under Review***


[[Paper]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=FOcleL0ltt), [[Project Page]](https://sites.google.com/view/unicomposer)


- *UniComposer*: the first band-level music generation system that involves collaborative roles of instruments, tailored to harmonize, provide rhythm, with careful selection of instruments to match the melody's expressive qualities, through cascaded bar-based diffusion models.
- An approach that integrates the advantages of both symbolic and audio music, using separate encoders and a shared decoder to bridge both formats within a common feature space, while gaining computational efficiency as well.

***ECCV 2024***


[[Paper]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-73226-3_15)


- Formulate the fragment selection subtask for manuscript restoration as a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem, and introduce *LLMCO4MR*, a LLMs-aided Neural Combinatorial Optimization solver.
- The first to restore the manuscript from a subset of fragments with *outliers*, and introduce MLLMs for manuscript recovery and jigsaw puzzle-like tasks. We carry assembly on Dunhuang manuscripts, Dead Sea papyrus, and Chinese oracle bone fragments.

***EMNLP 2024***

[[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.163/)

- *PhiloCorpus-ZH*, a collection of ancient Chinese manuscripts; and *PhiloBenchmark* including 9 tasks to assess the performance of ancient Chinese LLMs for manuscript discoveries.
- *PhiloCoP*, a framework that adheres to chain-of-thoughts for philologists navigating vocabulary and grammatical phenomena in classical Chinese. *PhiloGPT* has been applied to tasks including the restoration and distinction of Dunhuang manuscripts.
